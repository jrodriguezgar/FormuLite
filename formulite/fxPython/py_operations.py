    Evaluates a compound arithmetic expression from a string.

    This function safely evaluates a string containing a mathematical expression,
    respecting the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). It also
    handles implicit multiplication, e.g., converting '3(4+2)' to '3*(4+2)'.

    The cost of this function depends on the complexity of the expression
    but is generally efficient for common arithmetic.

    Args:
        expression_string (str): The mathematical expression to be evaluated.

    Returns:
        (int | float): The numerical result of the expression.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the expression string is syntactically incorrect,
                    attempts a division by zero, or contains invalid characters.

    Example of use:
        result1 = evaluate_compound_expression("3 + 4 * 5")
        # result1 will be 23

        result2 = evaluate_compound_expression("2 * 3(6 / 2) - 9 + 6")
        # result2 will be 15.0
    """

    # Why: The standard eval() does not understand implicit multiplication (e.g., '3(4)').
    # This regular expression finds a number or a closing parenthesis followed by
    # an opening parenthesis and inserts a '*' to make it explicit.
    processed_string = re.sub(r'(?<=[0-9\)])\s*\(', '*(', expression_string)

    # Why: Using a try-except block to catch common math or syntax errors
    # from eval() and present them to the user in a controlled way.
    try:
        # Why: eval() is powerful but dangerous if used with untrusted input.
        # We restrict its scope by providing empty dictionaries for globals and locals,
        # which prevents it from accessing system functions or variables.
        # The {"__builtins__": {}} part is the key security measure.
        allowed_globals = {"__builtins__": {}}
        allowed_locals = {}
        
        result = eval(processed_string, allowed_globals, allowed_locals)
        return result

    except (SyntaxError, ZeroDivisionError, NameError, TypeError) as e:
        # Why: Raise a single, clear error type to the user, embedding the
        # original error message for better debugging.
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid or malformed expression provided: {e}")

    """
    Searches for a target element within an iterable collection.

    This function iterates through the provided collection to find the first
    occurrence of the `target_element`. It is designed to work with any
    iterable, such as lists, tuples, sets, and generators.

    Args:
        collection (Iterable[Any]): The collection to be searched.
        target_element (Any): The element to search for.

    Returns:
        Optional[Any]: The found element, or `None` if the element is not found.
        The return type is `Optional[Any]` to clearly indicate that the function
        might not return an element.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the provided `collection` is not an iterable.

    Example of use:
        >>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        >>> search(my_list, 3)
        3
        >>> search(my_list, 6)
        None

    Cost:
        The time complexity is O(N) in the worst-case scenario, where N is the
        number of elements in the collection, as it may need to check every
        element. In the best case, it is O(1) if the element is the first in
        the collection. The space complexity is O(1) as no extra storage is
        needed.
