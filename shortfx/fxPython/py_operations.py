shortfx - fxPython: Python Operations Module

This module provides advanced utility functions for Python data structure operations.
It includes functions for:
- JSON manipulation and merging
- List, tuple, and set operations (unique, flatten, intersection)
- Dictionary operations and filtering
- Subsequence and sublist checking
- Collection filtering and merging
- Command execution and expression evaluation
- Interactive user selection from collections

All functions follow PEP standards with complete documentation including
complexity analysis.

    given as alternating ``(range, criteria)`` arguments.

    Args:
        values: Primary range whose length determines the row count.
        *criteria_pairs: Alternating ``criteria_range, criteria`` arguments.
            Must contain an even number of elements.

    Returns:
        Number of indices where **all** criteria are met.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If *criteria_pairs* length is odd or ranges differ in length.

    Example:
        >>> count_ifs(
        ...     [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        ...     [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], ">1",
        ...     [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "<5",
        ... )
        3

    Complexity: O(n * k) where k is the number of criteria pairs.
