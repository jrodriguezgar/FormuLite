## 🌟 What is shortfx?

**The largest open-source Python formula library available.** With **2,932 ready-to-use functions** across 6 modules, shortfx is the most comprehensive collection of reusable formulas for everyday operations:

| Module | Functions | Scope |
|--------|----------:|-------|
| `fxNumeric` | 1,602 | Finance, statistics, geometry, transforms, series, number theory |
| `fxExcel` | 489 | Excel-compatible formulas (VLOOKUP, PMT, CONCATENATE …) |
| `fxString` | 331 | Text manipulation, regex, hashing, validation, encoding, similarity |
| `fxDate` | 261 | Date operations, evaluations, conversions, system dates |
| `fxVBA` | 133 | VBA/Access-compatible functions (Left, InStr, Format …) |
| `fxPython` | 116 | Iterable utilities, type conversions, logic helpers |

It simplifies tasks that in standard Python would require:

1. Several lines of repetitive code.
2. Complex coding using loops.
3. Importing multiple libraries and using advanced patterns.

shortfx follows the philosophy of simplicity and efficiency: **do one thing and do it well**.

## 🛠️ Installation

You can install shortfx using pip:

```bash
pip install shortfx
```

## 📖 Usage

###  Date Manipulation (`fxDate`)
[View full documentation](shortfx/fxDate/README.md)

Perform date calculations, validations, and arithmetic intuitively.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from shortfx.fxDate import date_operations

# Add days to a date
start_date = datetime(2025, 1, 15)
new_date = date_operations.add_time_to_date(start_date, 30, 'days')

# Validate a date (February 30th does not exist)
is_valid = date_operations.is_valid_date("2025-02-30")  # Result: False
```

### 🧮 Numeric and Financial Operations (`fxNumeric`)
[View full documentation](shortfx/fxNumeric/README.md)

Precise financial, statistical, and mathematical calculations.

```python
from shortfx.fxNumeric import finance_functions

# Calculate Future Value (FV)
# Rate: 5%, Periods: 10, Payment: -100, Present Value: -1000
fv = finance_functions.future_value(rate=0.05, nper=10, pmt=-100, pv=-1000)
# Result: 1276.28...
```

### 🔡 String Manipulation (`fxString`)
[View full documentation](shortfx/fxString/README.md)

Advanced tools for string search, cleaning, and analysis.

```python
from shortfx.fxString import string_operations

# Find substring positions
text = "Programming is fun, programming is great"
positions = string_operations.position_in_string(text, "is")
# Result: [13, 36] (returns all occurrences)
```

### 🐍 Python Utilities (`fxPython`)
[View full documentation](shortfx/fxPython/README.md)

Common design patterns and tools for iterables.

```python
from shortfx.fxPython import py_tools, py_itertools

# Create dictionary from parallel lists
dictionary = py_tools.create_key_value_dictionary("id,name", (1, "Alice"))
# Result: {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}

# Take the first N items from any iterable
first_items = py_itertools.take(3, range(10))
# Result: [0, 1, 2]
```

### 🖥️ Excel-style Functions (`fxExcel`)
[View full documentation](shortfx/fxExcel/README.md)

The `fxExcel` module exposes functions with names and behaviors identical to those in Excel.

```python
from shortfx import fxExcel

# VLOOKUP Example
table = [
    ["Name", "Age", "City"],
    ["Ana", 25, "Madrid"],
    ["Juan", 30, "Barcelona"]
]

# Find the age (column 2) of "Ana"
age = fxExcel.VLOOKUP("Ana", table, 2)  # Result: 25

# Concatenate text
greeting = fxExcel.CONCATENATE("Hello", " ", "World")  # Result: "Hello World"
```

### 🏗️ VBA Compatibility (`fxVBA`)
[View full documentation](shortfx/fxVBA/README.md)

If you come from the world of Excel or Access macros, you will feel immediately familiar.

```python
from shortfx import fxVBA

text = "Hello World"

# Get left characters (Left)
start = fxVBA.Left(text, 5)  # Result: "Hello"

# Find text position (InStr is 1-based, like in VBA)
position = fxVBA.InStr(1, text, "World")  # Result: 7
```

## 🤖 AI Integration (LLMs & MCP)

shortfx is designed to work as a **deterministic tool layer for AI agents**. Large language models are excellent at reasoning, but they can produce inconsistent or incorrect results when performing calculations, date arithmetic, or string transformations. shortfx solves this by providing tested, reliable functions that always return the same output for the same input.

### Why Dynamic Tool Definition?

shortfx exposes **2,932 functions**, far too many to register each one as an individual MCP tool (which would overwhelm any AI agent's context window). Instead, the MCP server uses a **dynamic discovery pattern** with a small set of meta-tools:

| Meta-Tool | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `search_shortfx_tools` | Find functions by natural language query (semantic search) |
| `list_shortfx_tools` | Browse all functions, optionally filtered by module |
| `get_shortfx_tool_details` | Get full parameter schema for a specific function |
| `call_shortfx` | Execute any function by its qualified name |
| `scientific_calculate` | Evaluate math expressions directly (AST-based, no eval) |

### Recommended AI Workflow

```
1. SEARCH   → search_shortfx_tools("calculate days between two dates")
2. INSPECT  → get_shortfx_tool_details("fxDate.date_operations.calculate_days_between_dates")
3. EXECUTE  → call_shortfx("fxDate.date_operations.calculate_days_between_dates",
                             '{"start_date": "2025-01-01", "end_date": "2025-12-31"}')
```

### Two Ways AI Can Discover Functions

| Method | Best For | How It Works |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **`llms.txt`** | LLMs with file access (Copilot, Cursor, etc.) | A static index of all 2,932 functions with signatures and descriptions. The AI reads it once and uses Ctrl+F-style lookup. |
| **MCP Server** | AI agents with tool-calling (Claude, GPT, etc.) | A live server that exposes search + execute meta-tools over the Model Context Protocol. |

### Setup

```bash
# Install with MCP support
pip install shortfx[mcp]

# With semantic search (recommended for AI agents)
pip install shortfx[mcp-semantic]
```

Configure your AI client (VS Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor) as described in the [MCP Server documentation](shortfx/mcp/README.md).

## 🔒 Security

| Measure | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **No `eval()` / `exec()`** | Expression evaluators (`evaluate_expression`, `scientific_calculate`) use AST-based parsing with whitelisted operations only |
| **No OS command execution** | `subprocess` and OS shell access are not used anywhere in the library |
| **`apply_expression` sandboxed** | Attribute access restricted to built-in types; private attributes (`_`-prefixed) blocked |
| **DoS protection** | `factorial()` capped at n ≤ 170; exponents capped at ≤ 10,000; expression length capped at 1,000 chars |
| **No auto-install** | Missing optional dependencies are reported via logging — the library never installs packages |
